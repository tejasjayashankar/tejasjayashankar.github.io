**About Me**

I am a fifth-year PhD student in the [EECS department at MIT](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) 
advised by [Professor Gregory Wornell](http://allegro.mit.edu/~gww/). I received by M.S. 
degree in EECS from MIT in January 2022 and my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from 
the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://ece.illinois.edu/) in 2019. My 
research interests are centered around the use of generative models and representation learning for solving
problems at the interesection of neural compression, computer vision, information 
theory and signal (image/audio) processing. 

**Research Internship Experience**

I have had the pleasure of finishing multiple research internships in the past. Most recently
I worked with [Dr. Fabian Mentzer](https://fmentzer.github.io/) on the Neural Compression Team at Google Research (see [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12mXjO50qHUXiuk062CGNG6gNwtfHcO86uYLYbCLQmms/edit?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-onMp2_GuNQTqEIEbvpB1AA)). I also worked
with [Dr. Qing He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kgyV1ucAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Vimal Manohar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=8t3Ex0QAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) at Meta AI in 2021 and 2022
respectively where I worked on speech compression and singing voice conversion with generative models.
I have also interned with [Dr. Jonathan Le Roux](https://www.jonathanleroux.org/) at MERL in 2019, where I conducted research on adversarial attack 
detection.
