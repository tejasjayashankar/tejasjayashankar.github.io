**About Me**

I am a Research Scientist at Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL) where I currently focus on 
speech synthesis from Meta's multimodal models, particularly focusing on diffusion modeling 
and few-step generation for speech synthensis, neural codec training and post-training 
with a focus on reward modeling for RLHF.   

I was previously a PhD student in the [EECS department at MIT](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) 
advised by [Professor Gregory Wornell](http://allegro.mit.edu/~gww/). I defended my Ph.D.
thesis titled 
["Score Estimation for Generative Modeling"](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/164063) in May 2025.  Before that I completed my
 M.S. degree in EECS from MIT in January 2022 and my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from 
the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://ece.illinois.edu/) in 2019. 

<!-- My research interests lie at the intersection of generative modeling and representation learning. 
My current interests are in developing new techniques for score-based generative modeling
such as improved techniques for training diffusion models and using these models for designing
new one-step generators for downstream tasks such as inverse problems.  I am also generally interested in
the interplay between information theory and representation learning and have worked on
several projects related to neural compression with generative decoders such as vision
transformers, GANs and diffusion models. -->
