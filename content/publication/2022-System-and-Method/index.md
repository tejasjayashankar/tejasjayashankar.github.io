abstract: "A linguistic system for transcribing an input, where the linguistic system comprises a processor configured to execute a neural network multiple times while varying weights of at least some nodes of the neural network to produce multiple transcriptions of the input. Further, determine a distribution of pairwise distances of the multiple transcriptions; determine a legitimacy of the input based on the distribution; and transcribe the input using stored weights of the nodes of the neural network when the input is determined as legitimate to produce a final transcription of the input."
