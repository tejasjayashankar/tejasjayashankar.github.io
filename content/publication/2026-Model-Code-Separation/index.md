abstract: "A decoding methodology that receives data compressed by a universal encoder and a data model based on a sum-product network (SPN) representing statistical structure inherent to source data. The approach enables decompression using this data model, implementing a framework where encoding remains independent of the source model while decoding adapts to model-specific information."
