One of my current interests is the theoretical and applied study of diffusion
models for solving inverse problems in various domains and for developing new generative
sampling schemes by combining advances in neural compression and new insights from optimal 
transport. At the same time, I have also been doing research on new representation learning
techniques that can leverage spectral decomposition techniques for applications to
progressive image decoding and variable bitrate compression.

During my Masters, I proposed a new architecture for lossless and lossy image compression
by developing a novel algorithm for compression with model-code separated compression 
architectures (i.e., source-agnostic encoding and source augmentable decoding). During my
time at UIUC, I worked on developing new video frame interpolation technology by leveraging 
the Local All-Pass (LAP) optical flow estimation algorithm.
